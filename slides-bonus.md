## Screen reader demo

Navigating with VoiceOver

Notes:
I'm going to play a recording of me using the macos VoiceOver screen reader to navigate a page. This will help you better understand how these techniques can help a user of this tool navigate a page.



## Turn-based

Clarity regarding who should respond

> - **A:** What is your position? Over.
> - **B:** Two clicks south. Over.
> - **A:** Proceed as planned. Over and out.

Notes:
Fifth, a system should be turn-based. It should be made clear when one party is done responding and ready to receive a reply. For example, procedure words are special instructions people use for radio communication. Ending a response with "Over" is a quick and respectful way to mean that the person is done talking but they are waiting and listening for a rely. "Over and out" means the person is done listening.

## (Not turn-based)

Monologues or interruptions

> - **A:** (Rambling…)
> - **B:** Excuse me…
> - **A:** (Still rambling…)
> - **B:** Can I just…
> - **A:** (Rambling continues…)

Notes:
In contrast, when there is no space for responses, one party can dominate. This means the dialog is actually a monologue. A person wanting to have a conversation may be forced to interrupt the other who may just be rambling.

What experiences have you had (turn-based or not turn-based)?



## Truthful

Credible, verifiable, not confusing

> **Email from charity:**  
> Thank you for donating! We will email you quarterly reports detailing how your money is benefiting the cause.

Notes:
Sixth, a system should be truthful. What it says should be credible, verifiable, and not confusing. For example, a person who just donated to a charity received an email. It states, "Thank you for donating! We will email you quarterly reports detailing how your money is benefiting the cause." The message confirms the donation, but it also provides a way for the person to verify that the donation will be used as they intended. This gives the person confidence, which encourages them to continue their relationship with the charity.



## (Not truthful)

Expectation does not meet reality

> - **Note from ISP:** Sorry we missed you! Call this number to talk with us.
> - **Customer:** (Calls phone number.) Is this my internet service provider?
> - **Person called:** Why am I still getting these calls!? Wrong number!

Notes:
In contrast, a system is not truthful if the expectation does not align with reality. In this example, a customer could not immediately respond to a knock on the door. The technician they were expecting left a note that printed a phone number to call. The customer calls it, but instead of reaching anyone associated with the service provider, it called an unrelated personal phone number. The printed phone number was incorrect, and has been incorrect for months. This typo has made it frustrating for both you and this other person.

What experiences have you had (truthful or not truthful)?



## Polite

Respect time, anticipate needs

> 



## (Not polite)

Wastes time, rude

> - **Popup:** Spin this wheel to win!
> - **Person:** I'm just trying to read this article! I can't find the close button!



## Error-tolerant

Anticipates errors, recovers seamlessly

> - **A:** Turn right on Main St in two blocks.
> - **B:** Main St is in three blocks. Is the turn at Main St or in three blocks?



## (Not error-tolerant)

> - Technician arrives early, while customer is returning home.
> - Knocks on door, to no answer.
> - Leaves before appointment time.

Notes:
In contrast, a system is not error-tolerant if the expectation does not align with reality. In this example, a customer arrived home a couple minutes before a technician from their internet service provider was scheduled to arrive. They read a note on their door claiming the technician a
