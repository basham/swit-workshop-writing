## Product teams solve problems

Words are means of solving problems

Notes:
Product teams solve problems. This workshop is about being intentional with the words we use in our products so that they solve problems instead of create them.



## UX writing

The practice of using words to solve problems

Notes:
UX writing is the practice of using words to solve problems in digital products. You don't have to be a "designer" or a "writer" to get value from this workshop. This workshop is for any team member who has influece over the words that are used or how they are used.



## Books on UX writing

- [*Writing Is Designing* (2020)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1933820667/)
- [*Strategic Writing for UX* (2019)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1492049395/)
- [*Conversational Design* (2018)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937557677/)

Notes:
Last spring, I mentored an intern whose focus was UX writing. We studied three books and practiced what we learned. The books in order of value to us were: Writing Is Designing from 2020, Strategic Writing for UX from 2019, and Conversational Design from 2018. Many ideas for this workshop are borrowed from these sources.



## WCAG

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

[Accessibility Principles](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/)

[WCAG 2.1 Understanding Docs](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/)

Notes:
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (or WCAG) manages a robust set of guidelines pertaining to writing, among many other things. The "Understanding Docs" provides an approachable overview of the guidelines. This will be another primary source for content in this workshop.

> — *Strategic Writing for UX* (2019)

Notes:
"We need words is not the problem that we solve as UX writers," according to the book "Strategic Writing for UX." "We communicate. We invite action. We inspire loyalty. Our teams need to know that UX writing can be used to solve problems.



## Words should be…

1. Useful
2. Usable
3. Responsible

Notes:
How do we do this? The words we use in digital products should be useful, usable, and responsible. In this workshop, we will learn through examples and activities how to make our writing useful, usable, and responsible.



## Make writing…

1. Purposeful
2. Legible
3. Navigable
4. Clear
5. Concise
6. Inclusive
7. Contextual
8. Human



# Make writing purposeful

Part 1 of 8

Notes:
Part 1. Writing should be purposeful.



## Goal-oriented

Help both people and systems meet their goals

Notes:
Words that are purposeful serve a purpose. They are goal-oriented. In product design, that purpose should be to help people and systems meet their goals and solve their problems.



## Cooperation

Work together to meet individual goals

Notes:
Many goals can't be solved alone. It requires cooperation. People and systems must work together, so they can meet their individual goals.



## Meaningful exchange

Information or resources

Notes:
Cooperation is a give and take. It is a meaningful exchange of information or resources.



## Exchange with a system

Person ⇄ (Interface) ⇄ System

Notes:
Exchange happens between a person and a system through a user interface.



## Exchange with a person

Person ⇄ (Conversation) ⇄ Person

Notes:
A more common form of this meaningful exchange happens when two people engage in a conversation. We can use our experience talking with other people as a guide for the writing we use in our digital systems.



## Make it easy

Reduce required effort and upfront knowledge

Notes:
One way to be cooperative and have a meaningful exchange is to make the process easier for the other. One may have a means of reducing the required effort or upfront knowledge that the other needs to engage in the exchange.



## Be cooperative

> **Waiter:** Would you like wheat bread or gluten-free bread?
>
> **Customer:** Wheat, please.
>
> **Waiter:** Great.

Notes:
This happens when people in a conversation are cooperative. In this example, the waiter says, "Would you like wheat bread or gluten-free bread?" The customer responds, "Wheat, please." The waiter confirms, "Great." In this case, the waiter states upfront the options available to the customer. The customer can provide a simple response by selecting one of those options.



## Don't be uncooperative

> **Customer:** Can you call me when this table is back in stock?
>
> **Furniture rep:** No.
>
> **Customer:** Then what should I do?
>
> **Furniture rep:** Check back later.

Notes:
In contrast, a conversation can be difficult when there isn't cooperation. In this example, a customer asks, "Can you call me when this table is back in stock?" The representative of the furniture company replies bluntly, "No." The rep does not offer any further options. This requires the customer to follow up with, "Then what should I do?" The rep coldly replies, "Check back later." This unhelpful exchange was frustrating for the customer, and it will demand even more of their time and effort, if they really want that table.



## Mutual benefits

- Person reads The Home Depot's  
[*How to Hang Drywall* guide](https://www.homedepot.com/c/ah/how-to-hang-drywall/9ba683603be9fa5395fab90cbb4826d).
- Person purchases related products.

Notes:
Now for an example with a system. A home owner wants to hang drywall for the first time. This requires knowledge, materials, and tools. They discover Home Depot has an online guide to walk through this project with videos and written instructions. They've gained knowledge, but the page also lists the materials and tools that they may need. These product pages then display where to find the product in the customer's local store. In summary, the store aims to gain a loyal customer (and their money) by making it easy for the customer to learn about and complete their projects. Both the customer and the store benefit by this exchange.



## Share your experience

- **Who:** Person and person/system
- **What:** Working together
- **Why:** Achieve goals

Notes:
Now, I'd like to hear from you. Think about an experience you've had or know about, that involves a person and another person or a person and a system. How are they trying to work together to achieve their respective goals? Did that work out?



## Write a meaningful conversation

5-minute activity, 1–2 people

1. Select roles and goals of two people.
2. Write their conversation as a text message.
3. Finish when both sides achieve their goals.

Notes:
Now, let's spend up to five minutes on an activity. The goal is to role-play a meaningful conversation as if you're chatting over text. Select roles for the two people in the conversation, along with their individual goals. Finish when both sides achieve their goals. If done alone, then you just write down the full conversation. If done with someone else, then just act as one of the two people in the conversation. After the time concludes, we will discuss the activity.



## Example situation

- **Customer:** Wants dinner to be delivered for family of four.
- **Pizza rep:** Wants to orders to be efficient and friendly.

Notes:
Here's an example situation. The first person is the customer. They want dinner to be delivered for their family of four. The second person is a representative of a local pizza restaurant. They want to make a conversation be as efficient and friendly as possible. These "wants" are their goals for this conversation.



## Example conversation

> **Pizza rep:** Welcome to Pizza Planet. Is this for pickup or delivery?
>
> **Customer:** Delivery, please.
>
> **Pizza rep:** I see from your phone number that you've ordered from us last month. Would you like the same order or something different?

Notes:
Now, I'll read through the conversation…



> **Customer:** Remind me, what was the last order?
>
> **Pizza rep:** It was a large with feta, garlic, and pineapple. The breadsticks came with cheese sauce.
>
> **Customer:** Let's go with that.



> **Pizza rep:** That will be $26.50, with tax and delivery fee included. Do you want to pay with your credit card on file or at time of delivery?
>
> **Customer:** I'll pay upon delivery.
>
> **Pizza rep:** It should be delivered to your address on file in about 20 minutes. Would you like to receive text message updates to track the delivery?
>
> **Customer:** Sure!



> **Pizza rep:** Is there anything else I can help you with?
>
> **Customer:** No, that will be all. Thank you!



## Variations on pizza order

1. Pizza rep is unaware that they're out of pineapple.
2. Pizza rep gives incorrect delivery time.
3. Customer forgot to update delivery address since their move.
4. Customer makes call in a loud room in the house.

Notes:
There are countless ways this conversation could be played out. For example: [Read the variations.] There is no right or wrong outcome for the purpose of this activity. But don't focus on editing or refining the content of the conversation. Once you say something out loud, you can't un-say it. So just start and work forward.



## Sample situations

1. Customer schedules haircut.
2. Customer buys corn at the farmers market.
3. Customer asks post office about missing package.
4. Friend invites you to their birthday party.
5. Friend asks you to care for their pet this weekend.

Notes:
You could use the pizza ordering situation as the basis for your activity. Or you could use one of these provided on this slide. [Read off samples.] Or, you could invent your own.

[Perhaps everyone votes to select a situation that everyone does.]

Any questions before we start?



## Start activity

5 minutes



## Discuss activity



## Activity variations

Change:

- Time, place, environment
- Mental/physical impairments
- Outcome

Notes:
This activity could be adapted in any number of ways. You could see how the time, place, or environment may affect the conversation; how any mental or physical impairments may affect the conversation; or make it so  or mental state of one or both person affects the conversation; or alter the outcome so that maybe only one or none of their goals are met.



## Activity expansions

1. Build a user journey.
2. Sketch wireframes.

These conversations can used to start additional activities. For example, a user journey is 



## Questions

Make writing purposeful



# Make writing legible

Part 2 of 8

Notes:
In Part 1, we learned that writing is purposeful when it helps to achieve goals. In Part 2, we will learn how to make writing legible.



## Can you read this?

- Text alternatives
- Color
- Resize
- Layout

Notes:
Writing is legible if readers have the ability to distinguish the content in a text and perceive it as words and concepts.

Here are seven success criteria that WCAG makes that addresses the question, "Can you read this?" I'll briefly review these.



## Text alternatives

- [SC 1.1.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-content) (Level A)
- **Images/graphs:** Alt text
- **Audio/video:** Captions, descriptions, transcripts

```html
<img
	src="tomato.jpg"
	alt="A cluster of ripe
		cherry tomatoes growing
		in a community garden">
```

Notes:
First, the WCAG success criteria 1.1.1 is about text alternatives. Images that convey information should have a text description. Audio and video should have captions, descriptions, and transcripts. This provides alternative content for assistive technology like a screen reader or braille display. More information is available to users who may not be able to understand the content. Those who are not hard of hearing can still benefit from captions when in a noisy room or in a situation in which they're trying to be quiet.



## Not only color

- [SC 1.4.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/use-of-color) (Level A)
- Complement color with visual alternative

## Text contrast

- [SC 1.4.3](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum) (Level AA):  
**4.5:1** minimum contrast ratio
- [SC 1.4.6](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-enhanced) (Level AAA):

## Text resize

- [SC 1.4.4](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/resize-text) (Level AA)
- Resize text up to 200% without loss  
of content or functionality

## Questions

Make writing legible



# Make writing navigable

Part 3 of 8

Notes:
Now that the writing has a purpose and it is legible, now let's examine how we can make it navigable.



## Page navigation

- Title
- Headings
- Landmarks
- Links

Notes:
When landing on a webpage, you need to get oriented, move around, and navigate to other pages. This can be done with titles, headings, landmarks, and links.



## Page title

- [SC 2.4.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/page-titled) (Level A)
- More specific to less specific parts
- First part should match page heading
- Use delimiter between parts (`-`, `|`, `·`)

> Employee Center | All IU Campuses | One.IU

Notes:
The page title is the first piece of content presented to a user. This is what is displayed on a browser tab. Page titles typically consistent of multiple parts, in which it starts with a description of the page, gets more broad, and eventually labels the brand name of the site. That first part usually should match the primary heading of the page (h1). The parts should be separated with some character, such as a dash, pipe, or bullet.

For example, the Employee Center task page on One.IU starts with "Employee Center", uses a pipe character to separate parts, and finishes with the brand name "One.IU".
https://one.iu.edu/task/iu/employee-center



## Headings

- [SC 2.4.6](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/headings-and-labels): Descriptive headings (Level AA)
- [SC 2.4.10](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/section-headings): Section content (Level AAA)
- `<h1>` → `<h6>`

```html
<h1>Garden plants</h1>
	<h2>Pepper</h2>
	<h2>Squash</h2>
```

Notes:
Headings should be used, starting with the `h1` element, which stands for "heading level 1". The heading levels should stay consistent, in the right order and not skipped. They should proceed the content it describes. Its description should be relevant for its content. It should be succinct.



## Landmarks

[SC 2.4.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/bypass-blocks) (Level A)

| Element | Implicit role |
| --- | --- |
| `<header>` | banner |
| `<nav>` | navigation |
| `<main>` | main |
| `<aside>` | complementary |
| `<footer>` | contentinfo |

Notes:
Many HTML elements have an implicit meaning. They are "landmark" elements which means they help users of assistive technology to navigate a page. It helps them to skim to major sections of content, like the header/banner at the start of the page, the main content area, or the footer at the end of the page.



## Label landmarks

[Technique ARIA11](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA11)

```html
<nav aria-label="Primary">…</nav>
<main>
	<h1>…</h1>
	<nav aria-labelledby="nav1">
		<h2 id="nav1">On this page</h2>
		…
	</nav>
	…
</main>
```

Notes:
It is especially helpful to label landmarks when there are multiple landmarks of the same kind. In this example, there are two areas of navigation. The primary navigation doesn't have a visible label, so the attribute `aria-label` is used to just explicitly label it as "primary" for assistive technology users. The second navigation has the visible label "On this page" as a heading level 2. In this case, the nav's label is determined by using the `aria-labelledby` attribute, referencing the heading. The main element doesn't need a label, because there should ever only be one of those.



## Skip links

- [SC 2.4.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/bypass-blocks) (Level A)
- [Rivet header](https://rivet.uits.iu.edu/components/header/): `.rvt-header-wrapper__skip-link`

```html
<a
	href="#main">
	Skip to main content
</a>
```

Notes:
The links in the "On this page" navigation (which weren't shown) are examples of skip links. They just jump the page to another section of content. Skip links are also used at the start of a page, so that a keyboard user has the option to, for example, skip to the main content. This is useful for when someone is already familiar with the header/banner at the start of all the pages on a site. The Rivet Header component has a skip link built in.



## Link purpose

- [SC 2.4.4](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/link-purpose-in-context): In context (Level A)
- [SC 2.4.9](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/link-purpose-link-only): Link only (Level AAA)

| In context | Link only |
| --- | --- |
| [Learn more](#) about grow bag gardening | [Grow bag gardening](#) |
| Tap the Search icon in the upper nav | Use [Search](#) to find [gardening tutorials](#) |

Notes:
One should understand the purpose of a link by its surrounding context. However, links can be better if written such that the surrounding context is not needed.

For example, the link "learn more" requires the nearby text "about grow bag gardening" to understand what it is about. It is better to simple have the link text "grow bag gardening."

For the second example, the text says "Tap the Search icon in the upper nav". There is no link. You have to guess what it means, and hopefully you've already noticed the search icon. It is better to write "Use Search to find gardening tutorials" in which "Search" is a link to start a new search and "gardening tutorials" is a link to the search results for gardening tutorials and an in-context example of what to search for.



## Screen reader demo

Navigating with VoiceOver

Notes:
I'm going to play a recording of me using the macos VoiceOver screen reader to navigate a page. This will help you better understand how these techniques can help a user of this tool navigate a page.



## Questions

Make writing navigable

Notes:
What questions do you have about making writing navigable?



# Make writing clear

Part 4 of 8

Notes:
Now that you can read and use the text, let's learn how to make the writing clear and understandable.



## Clear text

- Language
- Unusual words
- Pronunciation
- Reading level

Notes:
We can make our writing more clear by paying attention to the use of language, unusual words, pronunciation, and reading level.



## Language of page

[SC 3.1.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/language-of-page) (Level A)

```html
<html lang="en">
```

Notes:
All pages should define the primary language of its text by using the `lang` attribute on the `html` element. In the case of English language content, use the `en` value. This helps text-to-speech software more accurately pronounce content.



## Language of parts

[SC 3.1.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/language-of-parts) (Level AA)

```html
<ul>
	<li lang="de">Deutsch</li>
	<li lang="it">Italiano</li>
	<li lang="fr">Français</li>
</ul>
```

Notes:
Where subsets of text differ from the page's primary language, use a different `lang` value on the containing element. `de` is German. `it` is Italian. `fr` is French.



## Define (or avoid) unusual words

- Multiple definitions ("gig")
- Jargon ("code blue")
- Slang ("shiner")
- Idioms ("hot potato")
- Acronyms ("ROI")
- Abbreviations ("lb.")

Notes:
There are many categories of words that we use which may be challenging for someone to understand. For example, "gig" may have multiple definitions depending on the context. "Code blue" is jargon, because it is meaningful primarily to medical professionals. "Shiner" is British slang for a black eye. "Hot potato" is an idiom meaning a controversial issue. "ROI" is an acronym meaning return on investment. "lb." means "pounds."

These words should be defined so users know what they mean in the given context. Or even better, the content could be written so these words are never needed.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-language_idioms
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jargon



## Define inline

- [Technique H54](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H54)
- Use the [`<dfn>` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dfn)

```html
<p>A <dfn>basil plant</dfn>
is an aromatic annual herb
of the mint family.</p>
```

Notes:
Where a word is defined inline on a page, wrap the word in a `dfn` or "definition" element. In this example, the text is "A basil plant is an aromatic annual herb of the mint family" and "basil plant" is wrapped in the `dfn` element.



## Link to glossary

- [Technique G55](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G55)
- Link to [`<dt>` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dt)

```html
<p>…<a href="#def-basil">basil</a>…</p>
<h2>Glossary</h2>
<dl>
	<dt id="def-basil">Basil</dt>
	<dd>…</dd>
</dl>
```

Notes:
Definitions can also be curated in a glossary. Words can be linked to the terms on the same page or another page. In this example, the word "basil" links to its definition in a glossary section near the end of the page. The `dl` or description list is the appropriate container to use for a set of key-value pairs. The link references the `dt` or "description term" element.



## Expand abbreviation

[Technique G97](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G97)

> First-year applicants of Indiana University (IU) must have a minimum GPA (grade point average) of 2.5.

Notes:
Abbreviations can be defined or expanded inline. For example, "First-year applicants of Indiana University (IU) must have a minimum GPA (grade point average) of 2.5." Now, the rest of the page can freely use IU and GPA because it has been declared.



## Declare abbreviation

- [Technique H28](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H28)
- Use the [`<abbr>` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/abbr)

```html
<abbr title="Indiana University">
	IU
</abbr>
<abbr title="verses">v.</abbr>
<abbr title="Ohio State University">
	OSU
</abbr>
```

Notes:
If the expanded form is not desired, it should at least be declared. This can be done with the `abbr` element. In this example, "IU v. OSU" contains three abbreviations which can be individually expanded to mean "Indiana University verses Ohio State University."



## Pronunciation

- [SC 3.1.6](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/pronunciation) (Level AAA)
- Link to or declare pronunciation after word
- IU students record their name with [NameCoach](https://kb.iu.edu/d/appu)

Notes:
Some words can be troublesome to pronounce. Like unusual words, their pronunciation can be expanded inline or linked to. For example, the NameCoach tool allows students to record themselves speaking their name. This can be listened to in Canvas, so the instructor or classmates can know how to properly speak their name.



## Reading level

- [SC 3.1.5](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/reading-level) (Level AAA)
- Target middle school reading level (grades 7, 8, 9)
- Ignore names and titles



## Plain language

> It's not dumbing down. It's opening up.
>
> — Sarah Richards, *Content Design* (2019)

Notes:
> In her book, Richards pointed out that you can make writing more accessible and usable through plain language that people with a variety of reading levels can understand. This practice helps cognitively disabled users, those who have recently learned the language you're writing in, and even people who are stressed.



## Predictable text

- [3.2.4](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/consistent-identification): Consistent identification



## Helpful text



## Consistency

Just like how conciseness has tension with precision, clarity has tension with consistency. Prioritize clarity over consistency.



## Use chronological words

| Spatial | Chronological |
| --- | --- |
| Top | Beginning |
| Bottom | End |
| Left | Before |
| Right | After |

Notes:
Spatial words like top, bottom, left, and right are not appropriate for describing content that can be experienced in linear ways. For example, when a website is on a mobile device, all the content stacks vertically. And when a website is being announced by a screen reader, it reads the content linearly. Words like beginning, end, before, and after should be preferred, because they scale in more contexts.



## Place critical info before a decision point

> New password: **abc123**
>
> *Password must include a symbol*



## Describe the action

- **Device dependent:** Click, Tap, Press, See
- **Device independent:** Choose, Select, Use, View

Notes:
In general, do not use words that describe the what the user should do with their device, such as click a mouse, tap the screen, press a button, or see the printout. Instead, use words that describe the action the user wants to do with the interface, such as choose an option, select text, use search, or view more details.



## Questions

Make writing clear



# Make writing concise

Part 5 of 8



## Quick and clear

To the point

> **Alert:** Document saved

Notes:
Fourth, a system should be quick and clear with its messaging. For example, after the user saves a document, an alert displays that just states, "Document saved." That's sufficient to inform the person that they're not going to lose their progress.



## (Not quick and clear)

Ambiguous

> **Alert:** System Error 5023

Notes:
In contrast, something that is ambiguous is not quick and clear. The user could encounter an alert that displays an error code. This code has no meaning to the user. The message doesn't inform them what happened or didn't happen, or what they should do next or not do next. This creates confusion, raises stress, and wastes time.

What experiences have you had (quick and clear or not quick and clear)?



## Comprehension

- Sighted reader: 2–5 words per second
- Screen reader: 35 syllables per second

> Don't be afraid to sacrifice brevity for clarity, especially when extra context is needed or useful.
>
> — *Writing is Designing* (2020)

Notes:
According to the book *Writing is Designing*: The average reading time for sighted readers is two to five words per second. Screen-reader users can comprehend text being read at an average of 35 syllables per second, which is significantly faster. Don't be afraid to sacrifice brevity for clarity, especially when extra context is needed or useful.



## Precision

Precision tends to be wordy.
Progressively reveal content with disclosures or links to other pages.

- Landmarks
- Short paragraphs

Notes:
Skimming is a behavior that is used whether you are sighted or not or whether you have a mental impairment or not. Break up content with headings, landmarks, and short paragraphs to facilitate skimming.



## Process

Editing



## Iterative

> Writing UX text is iterative, starting with less-than-perfect words, then replacing those words with slightly better words, and repeating until you find the best words. This is the way to make the text purposeful and protective, but also concise, conversational, and recognizable as coming from the organization’s brand.

## Turn-based

Clarity regarding who should respond

> - **A:** What is your position? Over.
> - **B:** Two clicks south. Over.
> - **A:** Proceed as planned. Over and out.

Notes:
Fifth, a system should be turn-based. It should be made clear when one party is done responding and ready to receive a reply. For example, procedure words are special instructions people use for radio communication. Ending a response with "Over" is a quick and respectful way to mean that the person is done talking but they are waiting and listening for a rely. "Over and out" means the person is done listening.

## (Not turn-based)

Monologues or interruptions

> - **A:** (Rambling…)
> - **B:** Excuse me…
> - **A:** (Still rambling…)
> - **B:** Can I just…
> - **A:** (Rambling continues…)

Notes:
In contrast, when there is no space for responses, one party can dominate. This means the dialog is actually a monologue. A person wanting to have a conversation may be forced to interrupt the other who may just be rambling.

## Context-aware

Sensitive to time, place, preferences

> **Phone notification:** Would you like to automatically turn on Silent Mode when you arrive at the movie theater?

Notes:
Third, the system should be context-aware. It should be sensitive to circumstances, such as time of day, location of the user, and any preferences the user has set. For example, a person's phone may be aware that they are going to a movie theater this evening, according to their calendar. Before leaving, the phone asks if silent mode should be turned on once they arrive, in order to avoid disturbing others during the movie.



## (Not context-aware)

Generic, insensitive, assumptions

> **Email:** Exciting news! You have been invited to "Celebrating the life of Jack." RSVP now!

Notes:
In contrast, a system can cause emotional distress if it does not tailor messaging for the situation. For example, an event platform that assumes that all events are a joyous occasion is insensitive to situations like a memorial arranged for friends and family of someone who recently died.

What experiences have you had (context-aware or not context-aware)?



## Truthful

Credible, verifiable, not confusing

> **Email from charity:**  
> Thank you for donating! We will email you quarterly reports detailing how your money is benefiting the cause.

Notes:
Sixth, a system should be truthful. What it says should be credible, verifiable, and not confusing. For example, a person who just donated to a charity received an email. It states, "Thank you for donating! We will email you quarterly reports detailing how your money is benefiting the cause." The message confirms the donation, but it also provides a way for the person to verify that the donation will be used as they intended. This gives the person confidence, which encourages them to continue their relationship with the charity.



## (Not truthful)

Expectation does not meet reality

> - **Note from ISP:** Sorry we missed you! Call this number to talk with us.
> - **Customer:** (Calls phone number.) Is this my internet service provider?
> - **Person called:** Why am I still getting these calls!? Wrong number!

Notes:
In contrast, a system is not truthful if the expectation does not align with reality. In this example, a customer could not immediately respond to a knock on the door. The technician they were expecting left a note that printed a phone number to call. The customer calls it, but instead of reaching anyone associated with the service provider, it called an unrelated personal phone number. The printed phone number was incorrect, and has been incorrect for months. This typo has made it frustrating for both you and this other person.

What experiences have you had (truthful or not truthful)?



## Polite

Respect time, anticipate needs

> 



## (Not polite)

Wastes time, rude

> - **Popup:** Spin this wheel to win!
> - **Person:** I'm just trying to read this article! I can't find the close button!



## Error-tolerant

Anticipates errors, recovers seamlessly

> - **A:** Turn right on Main St in two blocks.
> - **B:** Main St is in three blocks. Is the turn at Main St or in three blocks?



## (Not error-tolerant)

> - Technician arrives early, while customer is returning home.
> - Knocks on door, to no answer.
> - Leaves before appointment time.

Notes:
In contrast, a system is not error-tolerant if the expectation does not align with reality. In this example, a customer arrived home a couple minutes before a technician from their internet service provider was scheduled to arrive. They read a note on their door claiming the technician a



## Inclusive language
