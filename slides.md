# Writing for Product Teams

Statewide IT 2024 Workshop

Chris Basham

Notes:
Welcome everyone to this workshop. The words we use and how we use them in apps and websites should solve problems, not create them. Today, we will learn through practical exercises how to make content purposeful, concise, clear, and inclusive. You'll come away with strategies to integrate user experience writing principles and practices into your team's iterative process. First, let's start with some background and logistics.

## Meaningful exchange

Human ⇄ (Conversation) ⇄ Human

Human ⇄ (Interface) ⇄ System

Notes:
A conversation is the way people have a meaningful exchange of information. A user interface is the way people have a meaningful exchange of information with a digital system.



## Design principles

1. Cooperative
2. Goal-oriented
3. Context-aware
4. Quick and clear
5. Turn-based
6. Truthful
7. Polite
8. Error-tolerant

Notes:
We can make our digital systems feel more human and conversational. Here are eight design principles that we can follow: cooperative, goal-oriented, context-aware, quick and clear, turn-based, truthful, polite, and error-tolerant. I'll go through each of these in more detail.



## 1. Cooperative

Reduce required effort and upfront knowledge

> System: "You can do A or B."  
Human: "I choose B."  
System: "Okay!"



## (Not cooperative)

Requires effort and upfront knowledge

> Human: "I want to do C."  
System: "Nope."  
Human: "…?"



## 2. Goal-oriented

Helps both humans and systems meet their goals



## 3. Context-aware

Sensitive to time, place, circumstance

> Would you like to automatically turn on Silent Mode when you arrive at the movie theater?



## (Not context-aware)

Email to customer:

> Exciting news! You have been invited to "Celebrating the life of Jack." RSVP now!
