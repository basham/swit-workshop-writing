# Writing for Product Teams

Statewide IT 2024 Workshop

Chris Basham

Notes:
Welcome everyone to this workshop. The words we use and how we use them in apps and websites should solve problems, not create them. Today, we will learn through practical exercises how to make content purposeful, concise, clear, and inclusive. You'll come away with strategies to integrate user experience writing principles and practices into your team's iterative process. First, let's start with some background and logistics.

## Meaningful exchange

Human ⇄ (Conversation) ⇄ Human

Human ⇄ (Interface) ⇄ System

Notes:
A conversation is the way people have a meaningful exchange of information. A user interface is the way people have a meaningful exchange of information with a digital system.



## Design principles

1. Cooperative
2. Goal-oriented
3. Context-aware
4. Quick and clear
5. Turn-based
6. Truthful
7. Polite
8. Error-tolerant

Notes:
We can make our digital systems feel more human and conversational. Here are eight design principles that we can follow: cooperative, goal-oriented, context-aware, quick and clear, turn-based, truthful, polite, and error-tolerant. I'll go through each of these in more detail.



## 1. Cooperative

Reduce required effort and upfront knowledge

> - **Waiter:** Would you like wheat bread or gluten-free bread?
> - **Customer:** Wheat, please.
> - **Waiter:** Great.



## (Not cooperative)

Requires effort or upfront knowledge

> - **Customer:** Can you call me when this table is back in stock?
> - **Furniture rep:** No.
> - **Customer:** Then what should I do?
> - **Furniture rep:** Check back later.



## 2. Goal-oriented

Helps both people and systems meet their goals

> - Person reads The Home Depot's *How to Hang Drywall* guide.
> - Person browses related products.

## (Not goal-oriented)

One-sided or no-sided

> - 



## 3. Context-aware

Sensitive to time, place, circumstance

> **Phone notification:** Would you like to automatically turn on Silent Mode when you arrive at the movie theater?



## (Not context-aware)

Generic, insensitive

> **Email:** Exciting news! You have been invited to "Celebrating the life of Jack." RSVP now!

## 4. Quick and clear

To the point

> **Alert:** Document saved



## (Not quick and clear)

Ambiguous

> **Alert:** System Error 5023



## 5. Turn-based

Clarity regarding who should respond

> - **A:** What is your position? Over.
> - **B:** Two clicks south. Over.
> - **A:** Proceed as planned. Over and out.

Notes:

## (Not turn-based)

Monologues or interruptions

> - **A:** (Rambling…)
> - **B:** Excuse me…
> - **A:** (Still rambling…)
> - **B:** Can I just…
> - **A:** (Rambling continues…)



## 6. Truthful

Credible, verifiable, not confusing

> **Email from charity:**  
> Thank you for donating! We will email you quarterly reports detailing how your money is benefiting the cause.



## (Not truthful)

Expectation does not meet reality

> - **Note from ISP:** Sorry we missed you! Call this number to talk with us.
> - **Customer:** (Calls phone number.) Is this my internet service provider?
> - **Person called:** Why am I still getting these calls!? Wrong number!



## 7. Polite

Respect time, anticipate needs

> 



## (Not polite)

Wastes time, rude

> - **Popup:** Spin this wheel to win!
> - **Person:** I'm just trying to read this article! I can't find the close button!



## 8. Error-tolerant

Anticipates errors, recovers seamlessly

> - **A:** Turn right on Main St in two blocks.
> - **B:** Main St is in three blocks. Is the turn at Main St or in three blocks?



## (Not error-tolerant)

> - Technician arrives early, while customer is returning home.
> - Knocks on door, to no answer.
> - Leaves before appointment time.
